    <p><blockquote>Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Do me this favor. I won't forget it. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They'll tell you I know how to return a favor. Your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind. Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship. What's wrong with being a lawyer?</blockquote></p>
    <p>What's the matter with you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I going to make that baby an orphan before he's born? Only don't tell me you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. Hey, listen, I want somebody good - and I mean very good - to plant that gun. I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright? I don't trust a doctor who can hardly speak English.</p>
    <p>Michael, you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane! Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. I see you took the name of the town. What was your father's name? I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. Never let anyone know what you are thinking.</p>

      <p><blockquote>Don't ever give an order like that again. Not while I'm alive. In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns. I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship. If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone.</blockquote></p>

      <p>Hey, listen, I want somebody good - and I mean very good - to plant that gun. I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright? The hotel, the casino. The Corleone Family wants to buy you out. We're both part of the same hypocrisy, senator, but never think it applies to my family. I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart!</p>

      <p>Never let anyone know what you are thinking. Your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind. This one time, this one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs. Te salut, Don Corleone.</p>

        <p><blockquote>We're both part of the same hypocrisy, senator, but never think it applies to my family. Te salut, Don Corleone. Don't ever give an order like that again. Not while I'm alive. My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you.</blockquote></p>

        <p>I am sorry. What happened to your father was business. I have much respect for your father. But your father, his thinking is old-fashioned. You must understand why I had to do that. Now let's work through where we go from here. I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them, as you can see. They talk when they should listen. Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't do anything. Never let anyone know what you are thinking.</p>

        <p>It's not personal. It's business. I don't like violence, Tom. I'm a businessman; blood is a big expense. What's the matter with you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I going to make that baby an orphan before he's born? What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous! Michael, you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane!</p>
